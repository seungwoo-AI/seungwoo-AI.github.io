# Study | Deep Theoretical Understanding

This section systematically organizes theoretical learning and research exploration essential for advanced AI development, categorized into Independent and School-based studies.

---

## Independent Study

Independent initiatives outside formal coursework, including research lab experiences and self-driven studies.

### Lab Experience
Research activities, experiments, and theoretical studies conducted as an undergraduate research assistant.

*(Individual projects and detailed notes are organized in subfolders.)*

### Personal Study
Self-initiated studies into advanced topics beyond formal education, covering theoretical exploration and hands-on experiments.

*(Individual topics and case studies are organized separately.)*

---

## School Study

Academic studies completed through formal university courses, with critical reflections where applicable.

### Course Summary
Systematic organization of key theoretical concepts and methods learned through coursework.

*(Subjects such as Numerical Optimization, Linear Algebra, Stochastic Methods, Data Science, and others.)*

### Deep Critical Exploration
Reflections, conceptual questions, and deeper structural analysis arising during study.

- Analysis of vector spaces, basis, span, and dimension
- Structural understanding of linear transformations and compositions
- Exploration of isomorphism conditions
- Investigations into diagonalizability and eigendecomposition
