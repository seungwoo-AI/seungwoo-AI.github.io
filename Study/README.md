# Study | Deep Theoretical Understanding

This section systematically organizes both school-based and independent studies critical for advanced AI research, structured to allow for long-term sustainable growth throughout graduate research.

---

## 1. School Study

Studies based on formal academic coursework and structured curriculum.

### Course Summary
Comprehensive organization of theoretical concepts and methodologies learned through university-level coursework.

*(Subjects such as Numerical Optimization, Linear Algebra, Stochastic Methods, Data Science, and others.)*

### Deep Critical Exploration
In-depth critical reflections developed during study — including personal questions, interpretations, extended discussions, and independent analyses beyond what was directly taught.

---

## 2. Independent Study

Self-directed studies conducted outside formal coursework.

### Lab Research
Documentation of research assistantship (학부연구생) experiences, including deeper understanding of architectures such as YOLO, CNN concepts, and real-world AI engineering practices.

### Personal Study
Explorations driven by personal curiosity, such as applying AI concepts to cybersecurity, investigating LMM (Large Multimodal Models), and other emerging areas of AI research.

# Summary

This structure separates formal coursework mastery from personal exploration and applied research experiences, supporting a sustainable framework for continuous academic and independent research development throughout graduate studies and beyond.
