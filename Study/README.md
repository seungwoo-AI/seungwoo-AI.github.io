# Study | Deep Theoretical Understanding

This section organizes two tiers of theoretical development critical for advanced AI research:

1. **Course Summary:** Systematic organization of core concepts learned through university-level coursework.
2. **Deep Critical Exploration:** Personal reflections, questions, and independent studies developed through critical analysis and further exploration.

---

## Course Summary

Key theoretical concepts and methods systematically studied through formal academic lectures and materials.  
(Subjects such as Numerical Optimization, Linear Algebra, Stochastic Methods, Data Science, and others.)

*(Individual subject notes and details are organized in their respective subfolders.)*

---

## Deep Critical Exploration

Personal investigations and reflections that originated from critical thinking during study, leading to deeper understanding and independent research.

- Critical analysis of fundamental structures in vector spaces, linear transformations, and matrix decompositions
- Exploration of conditions for diagonalizability and their geometric interpretations
- Independent studies beyond coursework, including 3D YOLO extension, Mamba architecture analysis, and long-context LLM research

# Summary

This dual structure demonstrates both a solid foundation in fundamental theories and the ability to extend knowledge through critical thinking and self-driven research.
