# Study | Deep Theoretical Understanding

This section systematically organizes both school-based and independent studies critical for advanced AI research, structured to support long-term sustainable growth throughout graduate research and beyond.

## 1. School Study

Studies based on formal academic coursework and structured curriculum.

### Course Summary
Comprehensive organization of theoretical concepts and methodologies learned through university-level coursework.

*(Subjects such as Numerical Optimization, Linear Algebra, Stochastic Methods, Data Science, and others.)*

*(Individual subject notes are organized separately in their respective subfolders.)*

### Deep Critical Exploration
In-depth critical reflections developed during study — including personal questions, interpretations, extended discussions, and independent analyses beyond what was directly taught.

This includes:
- Conceptual distinctions and deeper understanding of mathematical structures (e.g., vector spaces, linear transformations)
- Analytical thinking about properties such as diagonalizability, rank-nullity, kernel-image structures
- Extended explorations through independent questioning and discussions (e.g., via GPT conversations, supplementary research)

## 2. Independent Study

Self-directed studies conducted outside formal coursework.

### Lab Research
Documentation of research assistant (학부연구생) experiences and related technical studies.

- Deeper investigation of object detection architectures (e.g., YOLO)
- Study of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and related engineering concepts
- Practical exposure to real-world AI systems and modeling practices

### Personal Study
Explorations driven by pure curiosity, aimed at expanding understanding beyond formal curriculum.

- Investigations into how AI applies to cybersecurity domains
- Studies on Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and future AI architectures
- Thematic readings, experiments, and reflections on emerging research areas

# Summary

This three-tiered structure demonstrates:
- Mastery of formal academic foundations (School Study)
- Ability to think critically and extend beyond direct instruction (Deep Critical Exploration)
- Initiative and curiosity to independently explore advanced topics (Independent Study)

Through this framework, I aim to continuously expand theoretical understanding and practical research capacity in the field of AI.
