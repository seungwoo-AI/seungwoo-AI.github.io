# Deep Critical Exploration  
_Seungwoo Lee | AI Research Portfolio_

## 1. Key Questions

- How can I systematically record my study and research progress for KAIST and overseas graduate school applications?
- What is the optimal structure for distinguishing between lightweight study notes and in-depth research records?
- How should I balance the need for sharing my understanding (portfolio) and protecting my ideas (license management)?
- In numerical optimization, how deeply must I understand concepts like gradient descent, stochastic methods, and optimization theory to meet a "researcher-level" standard?

## 2. Explorations and Discussions

### Study and Research Recording Strategy
- **Velog**: Lightweight study notes and daily logs (no strict quality filter).
- **GitHub Repositories**: 
  - **seungwoo-AI.github.io**: Only upload posts with an understanding score of **80+** (theoretical studies) or **90+** (YOLO 3D research).
  - **Separate code repositories**: Manage complete, runnable code projects separately (e.g., YOLO-3D-Project).

### Quality Benchmark
- Numerical Optimization, Linear Algebra, and theoretical topics → Only if **understanding level ≥ 80**.
- YOLO 3D core research and implementation → Only if **understanding level ≥ 90**.

### Licensing and Idea Protection
- Chose **Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License (CC BY-NC 4.0)**.
- Strategy: Open knowledge for learning showcase, but restrict unauthorized commercial use.

## 3. Mathematical Insights

### Gradient Descent
- Interpretation as steepest descent following the negative gradient direction.
- Importance of small step size (learning rate) to ensure stable convergence.

### Stochastic Gradient Descent
- Introduced mini-batch optimization to overcome computational burden.
- Recognized trade-offs between convergence speed and noise in updates.

### Taylor Series Approximation
- Foundation for linear approximation of multivariable functions in optimization.

## 4. Visual and Structural Intuitions

- **Neural Network**: Matrix operations (inner product) represent weighted sums of inputs in neurons.
- **Optimization**: Gradient represents the direction and steepness of fastest increase; moving against it minimizes cost functions.
- **Learning flow**: Conceptual hierarchy  
  ➔ Mathematical foundation  
  ➔ Algorithmic implementation  
  ➔ Real-world application (YOLO 3D).

## 5. Final Insights and Strategic Decisions

- **Repository Architecture**
  - `seungwoo-AI.github.io`: Academic showcase (site for professors and admissions).
  - Separate repositories for full implementation codes.

- **Portfolio Curation**
  - Only post if the understanding level meets rigorous standards (80+/90+).
  - Maintain high quality over quantity.

- **Protection and Professionalism**
  - Legal protection via license.
  - Structured, intentional project documentation.

- **Growth Mindset**
  - Continuously refine study depth until reaching 85+ level (targeting "ready-to-publish" level in numerical optimization and YOLO 3D).
