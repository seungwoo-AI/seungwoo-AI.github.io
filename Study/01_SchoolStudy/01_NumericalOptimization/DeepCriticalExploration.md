## 1. Key Questions (score ≥ 80) & Findings  

| # | Critical Question (raised by you) | Core Exploration | Mathematical Insight | Visual / Geometric Intuition | Final Insight |
|---|-----------------------------------|------------------|----------------------|------------------------------|---------------|
| **Q1** | Under what conditions is **Gradient Descent (GD)** guaranteed to converge? | Examined *L-smooth* + *µ-strongly-convex* assumption; used $$\|\nabla f(x)-\nabla f(y)\|\le L\|x-y\|$$ and $$f(x_k)-f^\*\le(1-\tfrac{µ}{L})^{k}\bigl(f(x_0)-f^\*\bigr).$$ | Linear rate $$\mathcal O\!\bigl((1-\frac{µ}{L})^{k}\bigr)$$ when $$0<\eta<2/L$$. | Level-set ellipses shrink homothetically toward the minimizer. | **Step size** must respect the curvature upper bound *L* to ensure descent. |
| **Q2** | Why is the search direction in GD equal to $$-\nabla f(x)$$? | Used the first-order Taylor decrease $$f(x+\Delta)\approx f(x)-\eta\|\nabla f(x)\|^{2}$$. | $$-\nabla f(x)$$ is the steepest-descent direction in the Euclidean norm. | Tangent-plane picture: the negative gradient points straight “downhill.” | Optimal in a first-order sense; other norms lead to pre-conditioned directions. |
| **Q3** | How do the convergence rates of **Batch GD, SGD, and Newton’s method** compare mathematically? | Derived rates: GD → linear, SGD → sub-linear $$\mathcal O(1/\sqrt{k})$$, Newton → quadratic near optimum. | Used expectation bounds for the SGD variance term. | Error-curve sketch: Newton rockets down when close, GD slopes steadily, SGD flattens slowly. | Choosing an algorithm trades data-pass cost against accuracy. |
| **Q4** | What is the fundamental difference between **Momentum** and **Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG)**? | Unrolled update equations; NAG looks one step ahead, adding an extra corrective term. | Momentum: $$v_{k+1}=βv_{k}+∇f(x_{k})$$; NAG: $$v_{k+1}=βv_{k}+∇f(x_{k}+βv_{k})$$. | The velocity vector overshoots; NAG “anticipates” curvature. | NAG typically converges faster in narrow valleys. |
| **Q5** | How can the **Hessian** be used to classify a point as a local minimum, maximum, or saddle? | Performed eigen-analysis: positive-definite ⇒ local min, negative-definite ⇒ local max, indefinite ⇒ saddle. | Applied Sylvester’s criterion in 2-D; general positive-definite test via Cholesky factorization. | Contour map bends upward/downward along eigen-axes. | The Hessian guides second-order methods and curvature-aware step sizes. |
| **Q6** | Compare **Newton’s method** and **GD** in terms of convergence speed and computational cost. | Newton update $$x_{k+1}=x_{k}-H^{-1}\nabla f(x_k)$$; quadratic rate vs linear. | Per-step cost $$\mathcal O(n^{3})$$ for solving the linear system. | Newton “jumps” directly to the bottom in a quadratic bowl. | Best when dimension is moderate or Hessian structure is exploitable. |
| **Q7** | Why is **Lipschitz continuity** important, and in which algorithms is it used? | It bounds function growth ⇒ ensures Armijo/Wolfe line-search success. | $$|f(x)-f(y)|\le L\|x-y\|$$ ⇒ safe upper bound on step size. | Graph curvature is capped by *L*; no sudden “cliffs.” | Central to convergence proofs of GD, NAG, Adam, etc. |
| **Q8** | Why do we need **backtracking line search**, and what is its algorithmic procedure? | Stepped through the Armijo rule with shrink factor ρ. | Guarantees sufficient decrease without knowing *L*; finds $$\eta$$ in finitely many trials. | Visual: progressively shorter jumps until the curve touches the Armijo line. | Makes GD robust to unknown curvature. |
| **Q9** | Explain the **Adam optimizer** formula and how it differs from Momentum. | Adam stores first (*m*) and second (*v*) moments with bias correction; update $$\hat m /( \sqrt{\hat v}+ε ).$$ | Combines RMSProp scaling with Momentum smoothing; adapts per-coordinate step sizes. | Elliptical step sizes shrink in directions with high gradient variance. | Excellent on sparse gradients—may diverge without proper weight decay. |

## 2. Cross-Cutting Mathematical Themes  

1. **Taylor expansions** connect derivatives to step-size choice; GD follows a first-order approximation of the minimum path.  
2. **Convergence-rate hierarchy:** *Quadratic (Newton) › Linear (GD with strong convexity) › Sub-linear (SGD)*.  
3. **Condition number** κ = L/µ explains why ill-conditioned problems slow GD but not Hessian-scaled methods.  
4. **Variance reduction** (SVRG, Adam bias correction) mitigates stochastic noise, trading extra memory for stability.

## 3. Visual-Intuition Cheatsheet  

- **Gradient field:** arrows point to the minimum; the negative gradient is the steepest descent.  
- **Curvature ellipses:** eigen-axes of the Hessian—long axis = slow direction; Newton rescales ellipses to circles.  
- **Loss-landscape slices:** GD zig-zags in narrow valleys; Momentum smooths the path; NAG “looks ahead.”  
- **Line-search wedge:** plot of \(f(x+ηd)\); the Armijo line is the linear upper-bound that the curve must cross.  

*(Sketch these by hand or with matplotlib for presentations.)*

## 4. Final Insights & Next Steps  

- **Assumptions (L-smoothness, µ-strong convexity)** are as crucial as implementation details.  
- Build **intuition first, proofs second, code last**—each layer reinforces the others.  
- Upcoming deep dives: **convex duality proofs, BFGS derivation, and saddle-escape mechanics in non-convex neural nets.**
