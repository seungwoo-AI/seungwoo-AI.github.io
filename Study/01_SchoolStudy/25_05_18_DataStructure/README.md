## 📘 Project: Inversion Count with Advanced Data Structures

This repository contains an in-depth technical exploration conducted as part of a university **Data Structures** course assignment.  
It focuses on solving the following algorithmic problem from **Baekjoon Online Judge**:

> 🔗 [BOJ Problem 1517 - Bubble Sort](https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1517)  
> Count the number of swaps required to sort an array using bubble sort.  
> Naive time complexity: O(N²)  
> Optimized goal: O(N log N)

## 📌 Core Techniques Compared

- ✅ **Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree)**
- 🌲 **Segment Tree**
- 🧩 **Merge Sort with Inversion Counting**

The project evaluates and compares the practical and theoretical performance of each method, emphasizing how **Fenwick Tree offers the best constant-time efficiency in practice**, even when all three algorithms share the same Big-O time complexity.
