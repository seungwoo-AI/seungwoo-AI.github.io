# Data Science | Deep Critical Exploration

This document presents personal reflections and deep critical thinking developed while studying Data Science concepts.  
It highlights questions that arose during study, investigations conducted beyond standard coursework, and key insights gained.

## 1. Structure of Vector Spaces

- **Initial Question:**  
  What exactly distinguishes a span from a basis?  
  How does dimension emerge from these structures?

- **Exploration:**  
  Investigated the minimal generating sets and how linear independence shapes the basis.  
  Clarified that dimension corresponds to the number of basis vectors.

- **Insight:**  
  A vector space's structure is fundamentally determined by its ability to be spanned by a minimal, independent set.

## 2. Deep Interpretation of Linear Transformations

- **Initial Question:**  
  How do the kernel and image describe the 'loss' and 'preservation' of information in a linear transformation?

- **Exploration:**  
  Studied the behavior of inputs mapping to zero (kernel) and outputs capturing the action of the transformation (image).

- **Insight:**  
  Kernel represents 'collapse' of dimensions, while the image represents the 'surviving structure' after transformation.

## 3. Composition of Linear Transformations

- **Initial Question:**  
  What structural behaviors emerge when composing multiple linear transformations?

- **Exploration:**  
  Analyzed the way composition affects the kernel and image, and how invertibility and dimension interact.

- **Insight:**  
  Composition intertwines transformations' effects, and invertibility depends on the preservation of dimension across mappings.

## 4. Nature of Isomorphisms

- **Initial Question:**  
  What does it mean for two vector spaces to be "essentially the same" through isomorphism?

- **Exploration:**  
  Investigated how linearity, injectivity (nullity = 0), and surjectivity (full image) establish a structure-preserving bijection.

- **Insight:**  
  Isomorphic spaces share not just size (dimension) but also deep algebraic behavior.

## 5. Diagonalizability and Structural Understanding

- **Initial Question:**  
  Why are not all matrices diagonalizable?  
  How do eigenvectors relate to this property?

- **Exploration:**  
  Connected diagonalization to the existence of a full set of independent eigenvectors.  
  Explored cases where eigenvectors fail to span the space.

- **Insight:**  
  Diagonalizability is a geometric simplification possible only when transformations stretch along independent directions without entanglement.

---

## 6. Rank, Nullity, and Geometric Intuition

- **Initial Question:**  
  How does the Rank-Nullity Theorem reflect the geometry of a linear transformation?

- **Exploration:**  
  Studied how the input space decomposes into null space and image space.

- **Insight:**  
  Rank and nullity measure how dimensions redistribute under transformation — capturing preserved versus collapsed directions.

---

## 7. PLU Decomposition and Determinant Structure

- **Initial Question:**  
  How does PLU decomposition simplify determinant computation?

- **Exploration:**  
  Investigated how permutation and triangular matrix properties enable efficient determinant calculation.

- **Insight:**  
  Decomposition reveals the determinant as the product of diagonal entries (with sign adjustments), reflecting a volume-preserving sequence of linear transformations.

---

## 8. Deeper View on Eigendecomposition

- **Initial Question:**  
  What structural simplifications do eigenvectors and eigenvalues bring to understanding transformations?

- **Exploration:**  
  Studied how eigendecomposition re-expresses transformations as pure scaling along independent axes.

- **Insight:**  
  Eigendecomposition reveals the natural "frame" where transformations act most simply — through stretching, shrinking, or flipping along specific directions.

# Summary

Through these critical investigations, a deeper and more intuitive understanding of the fundamental structures in data science and linear algebra was developed.  
Rather than accepting definitions passively, I sought to reinterpret them structurally and geometrically, connecting abstract theory to vivid internal models.
