## ðŸ“š Overview

This document summarizes the critical and deep exploration sessions conducted with Seungwoo Lee.  
It captures the key questions, mathematical insights, visual intuitions, and final understandings, focusing exclusively on questions rated **80 points or higher** based on the Researcher Level standard.

## âœ¨ Key Critical Explorations

### 1. Should "light records" and "deep records" be separated when documenting YOLO 3D research?

- **Critical Question:**  
  Is it more strategic to distinguish between lightweight notes (study progress) and in-depth research analyses (full experiments and theoretical investigations)?

- **Exploration Summary:**  
  - Light records (Velog): To capture ongoing thoughts and intermediate results.
  - Deep records (GitHub Pages): Only polished, complete analyses after achieving clear understanding.
  - Especially for YOLO 3D, where experimental iterations are critical, this separation prevents overwhelming the portfolio while ensuring depth is shown.

- **Final Insight:**  
  > Light and deep records must be explicitly separated for clear portfolio management and strong research impression.

### 2. At what level of understanding (point score) should content be added to the portfolio for top-tier graduate school applications (Seoul National University, KAIST)?

- **Critical Question:**  
  What minimum understanding level is necessary to confidently upload portfolio content targeting Seoul National University, KAIST, and similar institutions?

- **Exploration Summary:**  
  - 60+: Passable, but average.
  - 70+: Solid, above-average graduate student level, can impress professors.
  - 80+: Strongly recommended; shows readiness for active research.
  - 85-90+: Ideal for standing out among applicants (possible scholarships, active recruitment).

- **Final Insight:**  
  > Only 80+ point contents should be uploaded for a serious and competitive graduate school research portfolio.

### 3. Should small explanation codes and full runnable codes be treated separately in the portfolio?

- **Critical Question:**  
  How should example codes used for explanations differ from full-scale, runnable project codes in the portfolio?

- **Exploration Summary:**  
  - Example code (small snippets) for concept illustration should go into GitHub Pages (study notes).
  - Full runnable codebases (e.g., YOLO 3D full training pipeline) should be managed in separate GitHub repositories with git clone capabilities.
  - Clear separation ensures clarity and professionalism in portfolio structure.

- **Final Insight:**  
  > Treat explanation snippets and full runnable project codes separately to maintain clarity and demonstrate technical maturity.

### 4. What license setting is best when you want to showcase your portfolio but prevent unauthorized use of your code/ideas?

- **Critical Question:**  
  How to legally protect intellectual property while publicly sharing for academic and portfolio purposes?

- **Exploration Summary:**  
  - MIT License: Too permissive (allows commercial use).
  - Creative Commons Zero (CC0): No protection (fully public domain).
  - Best fit: **Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial (CC BY-NC) 4.0 License.**
    - Allows sharing with credit.
    - Prohibits commercial use without explicit permission.

- **Final Insight:**  
  > Apply CC BY-NC 4.0 License to balance openness and protection for portfolio materials.

## ðŸ§  Mathematical and Structural Insights

- Clear separation between "documentation of thought" (Velog) and "formal research record" (GitHub Pages) aligns with how research publications and notebooks are distinguished in academia.
- 80+ score threshold aligns with basic researcher qualification standards used internationally.
- GitHub Pages as a public research site requires strict curation: light notes are fine on Velog, but only polished research-grade material should be showcased.
- Treating runnable codes separately under `.gitignore` management mirrors best practices in real-world research groups and open-source collaborations.

## ðŸŽ¯ Final Core Strategy

| Category | Strategy |
|:---|:---|
| Study Notes (Velog) | Record freely, including work-in-progress and lighter thoughts |
| Research Portfolio (GitHub Pages) | Upload only if understanding score is 80+ |
| YOLO 3D Research Project | Upload only if understanding and documentation score is 90+ |
| Code Management | Separate runnable project codes into a dedicated GitHub repository |
