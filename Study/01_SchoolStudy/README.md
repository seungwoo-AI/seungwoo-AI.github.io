# School Study | Course-Based Learning Organization

This section organizes theoretical concepts and critical explorations systematically based on formal academic coursework.

Each subject consists of two parts:
- **Course Summary:**  
  Conceptual structure and fundamental definitions organized from detailed study notes.
- **Deep Critical Exploration:**  
  Reflections, questions, and independent investigations developed during in-depth study.

# How to Manage New Subjects

When completing the study of a subject, follow this process:

## 1. Creating DeepCriticalExploration.md

After completing deep discussions and critical thinking in a single conversation thread:

- **Instruction to give ChatGPT:**  
  > "Based on our entire conversation, generate a `DeepCriticalExploration.md` that summarizes key questions, explorations, mathematical insights, visual intuitions, and final insights. Output the document as raw Markdown syntax without rendering or interpreting it."

This will create a high-quality critical exploration document reflecting your thinking process.

## 2. Creating CourseSummary.md

After separately organizing detailed concept notes:

- **Instruction to give ChatGPT (with the concept structure ready):**  
  > "Based on this conceptual structure, generate a `CourseSummary.md` that organizes the main topics and concepts clearly and systematically, without deep critical exploration. Output the document as raw Markdown syntax without rendering or interpreting it."

This will create a clean and efficient course summary focused only on core structures and ideas.

# Purpose

This structure maintains clear separation between:

- **Course Summary** (what you learned structurally)  
- **Deep Critical Exploration** (how you thought and explored)

allowing sustainable management of your study records with minimal manual work.

> âš¡ **Note:**  
> This system is designed not to simplify study efforts, but to deepen and sustain critical exploration over long-term learning.
