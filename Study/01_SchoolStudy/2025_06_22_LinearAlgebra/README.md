**Linear Algebra**  
This section gathers the investigations carried out in preparation for the linear-algebra **final examination**. It distills the core theoretical results and critical explorations drawn from the formal courseworkâ€”covering vector-space foundations, orthogonality structures, eigen-analysis, similarity transformations, and their geometric interpretations.
