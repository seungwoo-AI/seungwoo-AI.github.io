## üìå Core Questions & Explorations

### Q1. What is the hidden state in LSTM, and why is it structured that way?

**A1.** The hidden state is defined as:

$$
h_t = o_t \odot \tanh(c_t)
$$

It is a compressed and modulated form of the internal memory \( c_t \). While \( c_t \) stores long-term context, \( h_t \) is dynamically filtered for use as output or for downstream layers.

---

### Q2. Are \( x_t \), \( h_{t-1} \), and \( c_{t-1} \) column vectors?

**A2.** Yes, their dimensions are:

$$
x_t \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times 1}
$$

$$
h_{t-1} \in \mathbb{R}^{h \times 1}
$$

$$
c_{t-1} \in \mathbb{R}^{h \times 1}
$$

Column vector format ensures compatibility with the weight matrices during gate computations.

---

### Q3. Why is \( z_t = [h_{t-1}; x_t] \) so long ‚Äî and why concatenate like that?

**A3.**

$$
z_t = \begin{bmatrix} h_{t-1} \\ x_t \end{bmatrix}
$$

Concatenation enables gates to simultaneously access prior memory and current input, increasing expressive capacity.

---

### Q4. Why are there four separate weight matrices \( W_f, W_i, W_o, W_c \)?

**A4.** Each gate serves a distinct function:

- Forget gate:  
  $$
  f_t = \sigma(W_f z_t + b_f)
  $$
- Input gate:  
  $$
  i_t = \sigma(W_i z_t + b_i)
  $$
- Candidate memory:  
  $$
  \tilde{c}_t = \tanh(W_c z_t + b_c)
  $$
- Output gate:  
  $$
  o_t = \sigma(W_o z_t + b_o)
  $$

Having separate weights ensures each gate can learn independently and avoids interference.

---

### Q5. What exactly does the output gate do? Is it redundant?

**A5.** Output is computed as:

$$
h_t = o_t \odot \tanh(c_t)
$$

Here, \( o_t \) controls what parts of the memory are exposed. Without this gate, all internal memory would leak to the output, eliminating dynamic control.

---

### Q6. Why separate input gate \( i_t \) and candidate memory \( \tilde{c}_t \)?

**A6.**

$$
c_t = f_t \cdot c_{t-1} + i_t \cdot \tilde{c}_t
$$

This design separates "what to write" (\( \tilde{c}_t \)) from "how much to write" (\( i_t \)), giving the network precise control over memory updates.

---

### Q7. Doesn‚Äôt sigmoid activation in gates cause vanishing gradients?

**A7.** Yes. The sigmoid function:

$$
\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}
$$

has a derivative:

$$
\sigma'(x) = \sigma(x)(1 - \sigma(x))
$$

which is at most 0.25. Repeated multiplications across time steps can shrink gradients. However, LSTM reduces this problem via additive updates in \( c_t \).

---

### Q8. How does LSTM numerically mitigate gradient vanishing?

**A8.**

$$
c_t = f_t \cdot c_{t-1} + i_t \cdot \tilde{c}_t
$$

Gradient flow:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial c_k} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial c_T} \cdot \prod_{t=k+1}^{T} f_t
$$

If \( f_t \approx 1 \), the gradient is preserved across long sequences, which is not possible in vanilla RNNs.

---

### Q9. Why is tanh used instead of ReLU or sigmoid?

**A9.**

$$
\tanh(x) = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{e^x + e^{-x}}
$$

Its derivative is:

$$
\frac{d}{dx} \tanh(x) = 1 - \tanh^2(x)
$$

Tanh outputs in \([-1, 1]\), is zero-centered, supports negative values, and avoids unbounded growth. These properties make it ideal for memory updates and controlled outputs.

---

### Q10. How do sigmoid and tanh collaborate inside the LSTM?

**A10.** Their roles:

- Sigmoid gates (\( f_t, i_t, o_t \)) decide **how much**
- Tanh transforms (\( \tilde{c}_t, \tanh(c_t) \)) define **what**

Together, they separate value generation and value control for stable, expressive updates.

---

### Q11. Why isn't \( o_t \) the final output? Why do we need \( h_t \)?

**A11.**

$$
h_t = o_t \odot \tanh(c_t)
$$

The gate \( o_t \) filters the internal memory, ensuring that only relevant, scaled information is emitted as output. It is not meaningful on its own.

---

### Q12. Is the final output of an LSTM always \( h_T \), regardless of how many cells are stacked?

**A12.** Yes. For many sequence-level tasks, we use:

$$
\text{Final Output} = h_T
$$

which contains information from the entire sequence via recurrent accumulation.

---

### Q13. Why hide information in earlier steps that may become important later?

**A13.** The memory cell \( c_t \) retains hidden information, even if it‚Äôs not immediately exposed via \( h_t \). This makes it possible to "resurrect" important details when needed later, enabling dynamic relevance control.

---

### Q14. What happens if we remove the output gate and use \( c_t \) directly?

**A14.** Output becomes:

$$
h_t = \tanh(c_t)
$$

or worse, \( h_t = c_t \). Both would eliminate control over memory exposure and increase instability. The output gate is essential for information filtering.

---

### Q15. Why does tanh come after \( c_t \), instead of outputting \( c_t \) directly?

**A15.**

$$
\tanh(c_t) \in [-1, 1]
$$

This bounding protects against exploding activations and ensures stable, interpretable outputs.

---

### Q16. Why is \( h_t \) a better representation than \( c_t \) for prediction?

**A16.** Because:

- \( h_t \) is dynamically filtered and normalized
- \( c_t \) is raw, internal memory not meant for direct exposure
- \( h_t \) is task-ready and compatible with downstream heads
