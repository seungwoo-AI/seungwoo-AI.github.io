# Seungwoo Lee | AI Research Portfolio
**seungwoo-AI.github.io**

Welcome to my AI research portfolio.

My work centers on **numerical optimization for deep learning**, **3D object detection (YOLO 3D)**, and **advanced neural architectures**. I pursue both theoretical analysis and experimental validation to build robust, efficient, and interpretable AI systems.

This site documents selected studies, research efforts, engineering projects, and peer-reviewed publications.
