# Seungwoo Lee | AI Research Portfolio
**seungwoo-AI.github.io**

Welcome to my AI research portfolio.  
I focus on **numerical optimization for deep learning**, **3D object detection (YOLO 3D)**, and **advanced machine learning architectures**.

This site presents my theoretical studies, project developments, and experimental research toward building robust, scalable AI systems.
